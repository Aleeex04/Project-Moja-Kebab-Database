## Project Description:
The Kebab Restaurant Management System is designed to manage the various aspects of a kebab restaurant, including managing orders, inventory, employees, and customer data. The system will use different database concepts such as integrity constraints, referential integrity, cascading actions, date and time data types, binary large objects, domains, indexes, users, privileges, and roles to ensure efficient management of the kebab restaurant.
